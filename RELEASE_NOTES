		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The configuration option, "Don't popup error dialog on receive error"
  has been changed to "Show error dialog on receive error". Your previous
  choice will be automatically changed to the new format.

* The option "Warn when pasting files as attachments" has been added to
  the Compose/Writing preferences page. This option was previously
  hidden.

* chmod 0600 is now set on *history files in the configuration directory.

* A new preference has been added to enable setting the chmod value of
  saved attachments: "Save attachments with chmod [   ]", found on the
  Other/Miscelleanous preferences page. The default value is 600.

* The creation and updating of .mh_sequences files in MH mailbox folders
  is now optional and disabled by default. This is controlled by a new
  hidden preference, mh_compat_mode. If you were previously relying on
  this feature, set mh_compat_mode=1 in clawsrc before running this
  version.

* A new hidden preference has been added, passphrase_dialog_msg_title_switch.
  This switches the placement of the dialogue message with the dialogue
  title in the passphrase dialogue. This can be useful for interacting with
  third-party programs such as KeePassXC.
    
* The top-level 'Mark' menu item has been renamed to 'Marks'. If you have
  set custom hotkeys for any items in this menu you will need to re-set
  them.

* New accounts now have all secure options activated by default,
  including TLS connections and SMTP AUTH.

* The option to accept valid TLS certificates is now activated by default
  on new accounts.

* Notification plugin: support for Ayatana indicator has been added.

* PDF Viewer plugin: support for image/x-eps (encapsulated postscript)
  images has been added.

* Libravatar plugin: the https URL, https://seccdn.libravatar.org/avatar,
  is now used by default.

* vCalendar plugin: CREATED/LAST_MODIFIED are correctly handled, and the
  VTIMEZONE component is used when present

* Various code cleanups.

* The English, Spanish and French manuals have been updated.

* Updated translations: Albanian, Brazilian Portuguese, British English,
  Catalan, Czech, Dutch, French, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,
  Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish.

		     the message is clicked and then disappears later'
