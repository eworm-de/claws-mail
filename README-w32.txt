               ==================================================

These are the necessary steps to compile sylpheed-claws using Microsofts
VisualC++ 6.0 or MinGW/GCC in a Win32 environment.
Please note, that these ports are in a very early development state:

 !     MANY FEATURES ARE UNAVAILABE, MAY CRASH OR EVEN DESTROY YOUR DATA     !
 !        PLEASE USE THESE PROGRAMS ONLY FOR TESTING OR DEVELOPMENT          !
 !            IF YOU USE THESE PROGRAMS, BE SURE TO MAKE BACKUPS             !

The first port of Sylpheed for Win32 was done by Werner Koch <wk@gnupg.org>
(author of GnuPG). Later Sylpheed versions are maintained by by Munesato Nakada
<munesato@post.co.jp>. This english installation help and the Sylpheed-Claws
port are derived from their work by Thorsten Maerz <info@netztorte.de>


1. Sylpheed-Claws Win32 branch:
-------------------------------
First get the libraries and install everything as described below. Then call
"patch_claws.bat" (in \dev\proj\win32) to create necessary files using some
unix tools (bison, sed, ...). Repeat this step after each "cvs update".


2. Get following packages:
--------------------------
All packages (except MS IPv6 package) are mirrored at the Sylpheed-Claws
homepage. Please refer to the link section below.

* Sylpheed sourcecode:
    sylpheed-sources            (sylpheed-0.9.4claws-w32-src.tar.bz2 or cvs checkout)
* Gtk+ libraries:
    glib-dev                    (glib-dev-2.2.2.zip)
    gtk+-dev                    (gtk+-dev-1.3.0-20030115.zip)
    libiconv                    (libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip)
    gettext                     (gettext-runtime-0.12.1.bin.woe32.zip)
    gtk missing headers         (gtk+-1.3.0-20030115-win32-includes.zip)
* Support libraries:
    libjconv                    (libjconv-2.8.1.tar.gz)
    fnmatch                     (fnmatch-dev-2003.8.25.0.zip)

    w32lib                      (w32lib-dev-2003.8.25.0.zip)
    gpgme                       (gpgme-dev-20020921.zip)
    openssl                     (claws_w32_ssl_dev_030904.zip)
    libcrypt                    (crypt-2.2.5-lib.zip)
    pthreads                    (pthreads-2002-11-04.exe)
* unix build tools (diff,patch,msgfmt,grep,sed,bison,flex,cvs)
    unix-tools                  (unix-tools.zip)


3. Create the source tree:
--------------------------

  1. Create \dev.
  2. Extract glib-dev, gtk+-dev, libiconv, gettext, libcrypt,
     pthreads directly into \dev (this creates \dev\lib, \dev\include, etc.).
  3. Extract or checkout the sources into \dev\lib\proj\sylpheed-claws.
  4. Extract fnmatch, libcompface, regex, w32lib to \dev\proj
     (creates \dev\proj\fnmatch, etc.).
  5. Extract libjconv to \dev\proj\sylpheed.
  6. Install the "IPv6 Technology Preview" and copy the headers from its "inc"
     directory into \dev\include. To disable IPv6, uncomment "#define INET6 1"
     in win32\config.h.


4. The resulting directory tree:
--------------------------------

\-dev                      (Gtk+ libs, libcrypt, pthreads below \dev)
  +---bin
  +---include
  |   +---openssl          (extract openssl-dev to \ )
  |   +---glib-2.0
  |   +---gtk
  |   \---gdk
  |       \---win32        (missing gtk-1.3 headers)
  +---lib
  |   +---glib-2.0
  |   +---pkgconfig
  |   \---gtk+
  +---share
  +---man
  +---doc
  \---proj                 (other libs and sylpheed below \dev\proj\)
      +---fnmatch
      |   \---src
      +---libcompface
      |   \---src
      +---regex
      |   \---src
      +---w32lib
      |   \---src
      +---gpgme
      \---sylpheed-claws   (standard sylpheed assumes MSVC project files here)
          +---ac
          +---faq
          +---intl
          +---libjconv     (The only support-lib installed here)
          +---manual
          +---po
          +---src
          +---files
          \---win32        (MSVC project files for sylpheed-claws)
              +---patches  (generated.diff, external bugfixes, etc.)
              +---apps     (optional: unix build utilities)


5. Building:
------------
  1. Change directory to \dev\proj\win32 .
  2. Create the autogenerated files using "patch_claws.bat"

  --- MS Visual C++ ---
  * To compile from the commandline, call "mk_ALL.bat".
  * To compile using the MSVC IDE, open either "sylpheed-claws_d.dsw" or
     "sylpheed-claws.dsw".
     - Make sure, that *.dsp and *.dsw files have DOS lineendings (CRLF).
     - Make sure, the correct target ("Release" or "Debug") is set in the
       project properties when selecting sylpheed-claws.dsw or
       sylpheed-claws_d.dsw, otherwise the linker complains about libc
       problems.

  --- MinGW GCC ---
  Edit "Makefile" and set DEBUGVERSION, GCCVERSION, CYGWIN and UNIXTOOLS
  according to your build environment.
  Afterwards, invoke "make".


6. Hints:
---------
* Before opening the project, some files have to be created by calling
  "patch_claws.bat" in \dev\proj\sylpheed-claws\win32. This will create
  version.h, some bison/flex generated files and the translations.
  You will need the files from unix-tools.zip or a running cygwin
  installation for this step.
* libjconv and glib need patches, when compiled from source. As libjconv
  is rather small, the patched version is provided with the source.
  The patch for glib (2.0.0 and 2.0.1) is available in "win32\patches".
