               ==================================================

These are the necessary steps to compile sylpheed-claws using Microsofts
VisualC++ 6.0 in a Win32 environment.
Please note, that these ports are in a very early development state:

 !     MANY FEATURES ARE UNAVAILABE, MAY CRASH OR EVEN DESTROY YOUR DATA     !
 !        PLEASE USE THESE PROGRAMS ONLY FOR TESTING OR DEVELOPMENT          !
 !            IF YOU USE THESE PROGRAMS, BE SURE TO MAKE BACKUPS             !

The main part of porting Sylpheed to Windows was done by Munesato Nakada
<munesato@post.co.jp>. This english installation help and the Sylpheed-Claws
port are derived from his work by Thorsten Maerz <info@netztorte.de>.


sylpheed-claws win32 branch:
----------------------------
This package contains the MSVC project files and patches for Sylpheed-claws /
Win32. Create the directory structure and install the libraries as shown
below. Then copy or checkout the sylpheed-claws sources.
-> Finally, apply the patches using "patch_claws.bat" (in the win32 subdir).


Get following packages:
-----------------------
All packages are mirrored at the Sylpheed-Claws homepage. Please refer
to the link section below.

    w32lib                      (w32lib-dev-20020323.lzh)
    gpgme                       (gpgme-dev-20020423.lzh)
    openssl                     (claws_w32_ssl_dev_020415.zip)

Create the source tree:
-----------------------

1. Create \dev.
2. Extract glib-dev, gtk+-dev, libiconv-dev, libintl.
   directly into \dev (this creates \dev\lib, \dev\include, etc.).
3. Extract or checkout the sources into \dev\lib\proj\sylpheed-claws.
4. Extract fnmatch, libcompface, libkcc, regex, w32lib to \dev\proj
   (creates \dev\proj\fnmatch, etc.).
5. Extract libjconv to \dev\proj\sylpheed.
6. Create the autogenerated files using "patch_claws.bat" in
   \dev\proj\win32.
7. Make sure, the correct target ("Release" or "Debug") is set in the
   project properties when selecting sylpheed.dsw or sylpheed_debug.dsw,
   otherwise the linker complains about libc problems.


The resulting directory tree:
-----------------------------

\-dev                      (Gtk+ libs below \dev)
  +---bin
  +---include
  |   +---openssl          (extract openssl-dev to \ )
  |   +---glib-2.0
  |   +---gtk
  |   \---gdk
  +---lib
  |   +---glib-2.0
  |   +---pkgconfig
  |   \---gtk+
  +---share
  +---man
  +---doc
  \---proj                 (other libs and sylpheed below \dev\proj\)
      +---fnmatch
      |   \---src
      +---libcompface
      |   \---src
      +---libkcc
      +---regex
      |   \---src
      +---w32lib
      |   \---src
      +---gpgme
      \---sylpheed         (standard sylpheed assumes MSVC project files here)
          +---ac
          +---faq
          +---intl
          +---libkcc       (This is from Sylpheed)
          +---libjconv     (The only support-lib installed here)
          +---manual
          +---po
          +---src
          +---files
          \---win32        (MSVC project files for sylpheed-claws)
              +---patches  (generated.diff, external bugfixes, etc.)

Hints:
------
* There are several files, that cant be build on Windows easily, as you
  need many unix utilities like autoconf, bison, etc. The necessary
  sources are provided in "win32\patches\generated.diff", so be sure to
  apply them calling "patch_claws.bat" in win32 subdir.
* libjconv and glib need patches, when compiled from source. As libjconv
  is rather small, the patched version is provided with the source.
  The patch for glib (2.0.0 and 2.0.1) is available in "win32\patches".
* Ready compiled translations (and a sample gtk config) are available
  in "files\locale" and "files\etc". To compile translations on your own,
  you need either cygwin or an unix like os, and convert the source
  (.po) files to utf8 before compiling.
  (Note: This point will change soon)
