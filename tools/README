* eud2gc.py

  WHAT IT DOES

  This python-script is a quick hack to convert an Eudora (v.3?) addressbook
  to vCard (GnomeCard) format.

  HOW TO USE IT

  You may do whatever you want with it! (Also regarding copying)

  However, the script is intended to use like this:

  			eud2gc.py <Eudora-addressbook-file> <Gnomecard-file>

  Be careful not to overwrite your original GnomeCard.gcrd!
  (But of course you might want to add the converted stuff to it)

* filter_conv.pl

  WHAT IT DOES

  This perl script provides easy conversion of your filtering rules
  form sylpheed's old filter system to the new filtering system used
  in sylpheed-claws. It reads '~/.sylpheed/filterrc' and outputs 
  '~/.sylpheed/matcherrc'.
  
  HOW TO USE IT

  Issue the following command from the 'tools' directory:

        perl filter_conv.pl

  That's it, the new filtering system is now implemented with your
  previous rules applied.

* gif2xface.pl

  WHAT IT DOES

  This perl script converts a monochrome (1 bit) 48x48 pixels GIF file
  into an X-Face graphic suitable for inclusion into custom headers of
  Sylpheed. An X-Face allows to quickly identify (or be identified as)
  the sender of a mail message in a xface-capable MUA (like sylpheed).

  HOW TO USE IT

  After obtaining the desired image for your X-Face you should:
    * scale it to 48x48 pixels (Image->Scale image on Gimp)
    * down color depth to b/w (Image->Mode->Indexed selecting "Use
      Black/White palette" and the desired dithering options (prior to
      indexing doing Image->Colors->Threshold allows you to select the
      b/w level if you don't want a dithered (dotty) image))
    * save file as non-interlaced GIF
  Then do:

      ./gif2xface < filename.gif > filename.xface

  In filename.xface will be the X-Face header ready to use.
  You can add a custom header in Sylpheed through Configuration->
  Preferences per account, "Send" tab, check "Add user-defined header"
  then "Edit..." if you want to add it via Sylpheed interface, or do

      echo "0:" `cat filename.xface` > ~/.sylpheed/customheaderrc

  if you want to create the custom headers file yourself (Warning: this
  method is valid only if you don't have any other custom header set or
  they will be lost!).

* kmail2sylpheed.pl

  WHAT IT DOES

  This perl script will convert an exported Kmail addressbook into a
  Sylpheed addressbook.

  HOW TO USE IT

  (You must run sylpheed at least once before running this script.)

  In Kmail's Addressbook choose '/File/Export List'. This will export
  your Kmail addressbook data to a *.csv file.

  If Sylpheed is running, close it.

  From the command line, execute the following:
 
	perl kmail2sylpheed.pl --kmailfile=/path/to/addressbook.csv

  Your Kmail addressbook data will now be contained in Sylpheed's
  addressbook, under the name 'Kmail Address Book'.

* ldif-to-xml.py

  WHAT IT DOES

  This python script converts the netscape ldif format address book to
  the sylpheed xml format.

  HOW TO USE IT

  Inside Netscape export your address book to a file.
  From the command line, execute:

      ./ldif-to-xml.py <path/filename>

  In case of trouble, just invoke your python interpreter directly:

      python ldif-to-xml.py <path/filename>

  Either way a file called addressbook.xml will be generated in the current
  directory. This xml file should be merged with or simply placed in the
  $HOME/.sylpheed directory.

* newscache_clean.pl

  WHAT IT DOES AND WHY IT DOES IT

  This perl script cleans up in '$HOME/.sylpheed/newscache'. Currently
  the newscache becomes littered with old directories and files - when
  you subscribe to a newsgroup a sub-directory gets created for it in
  ~/.sylpheed/newscache/[nntpserver], should you unsubscribe from the 
  group the sub-directory does not get deleted. Until this is done 
  internally this script will take care of some tidying up.
  
  This script removes directory trees of nntp servers that you no longer
  have an account for. Where an account exists it removes directories
  and files of those groups to which you are no longer subscribed.

  HOW TO USE IT

  Issue the following command from the 'tools' directory:
  
  	perl newscache_clean.pl
        
  This script uses the File::Path module, if you don't already have it
  installed, you can find it at the CPAN search site <http://search.cpan.org>

* sylpheed-switcher

  WHAT IT DOES
  
  This perl script is for users who like to move between the main
  sylpheed branch and the claws branch. Because of some differences
  between the stored options it is better IMO to use two separate
  '.sylpheed' directory trees. Doing that manually could prove to
  be tiresome, and so I've written this script to automate the task.

  The first time you run this script you enter the full paths,
  including the executable itself, to both the main version of
  sylpheed and the claws version. This information is then stored
  in a file in your $HOME directory called '.sylpheed-switcher'

  During this initial set-up, your '~/.sylpheed' directory
  is copied to '~/.sylpheed-main' and '~/.sylpheed-claws'.
  
  When you run sylpheed via this script, your '~/.sylpheed' directory
  is deleted and replaced with a symbolic link to either ~/.sylpheed-main'
  or '~/sylpheed-claws', depending on the option you choose.
  (On subsequent usage the symbolic link is deleted and replaced with
  a new symbolic link).

  HOW TO USE IT
  
  Initial set-up
  Enter the full paths to the executable, including the executable itself,
  example:
  
 	./sylpheed-switcher --claws-path=/usr/local/bin/sylpheed --main-path=
        /usr/bin/sylpheed
        
  After the initial set-up, use the following:
  
  	./sylpheed-switcher --claws	(to run sylpheed-claws)
        ./sylpheed-switcher --main	(to run sylpheed main)
        
  Additionally you can append --debug to run in debug mode.
  Use --help for more info.  	
 
  This script uses the File::Path and Getopt::Long modules, if you don't already 
  have them installed, you can find them at the CPAN search site 
  <http://search.cpan.org>

* update-po

  WHAT IT DOES
  
  This script is a message catalog translator's tool, it updates the .po 
  files named on the command line.

  HOW TO USE IT

  This script needs to be copied to and run from the 'po' directory.
  
	./update-po lang.po lang2.po ...

  to update one or more <yourlang>.po files from the sourcecode files
  named in POTFILES.in. The old .po file is save in a .po.old file.

  For example, when you want to update fr.po, run ./update-po fr.po, 
  then edit fr.po to update your translation.
