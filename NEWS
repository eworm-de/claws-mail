  can now be overriden by the Folder Property and Account
  preferences. The global preference no longer needs to be activated

* 3.14.1
--------

* 'hide_timezone', a new hidden preference that sets the timezone of
  date fields sent over the network to the unknown timezone value as
  specified in RFC 5322 §3.3.  Default value is false (i.e., send
  available timezone information).

* 'rewrite_first_from', a new hidden preference which  works around a
  limitation of some servers with 'overly-liberal parsers'. When this
  is turned on and the Content-Transfer-Encoding is set to 8bit or
  7bit, in a message body starting with 'From ' the 'From ' will
  become '=46rom ' (i,e, encoded form of 'F') and the Content-
  Transfer-Encoding will be changed to Quoted-Printable. When it is
  turned off no such modification will be made but it is very likely
  that an MTA will convert the 'From ' to '>From '. See RFC 4155 for
  further details. Default value is '1', turned on.

* Templates: it is now possible to attach a file, using
  '|attach_output{sub_expr}' or '|A{sub_expr}', 'sub_expr' is
  evaluated as a command-line to get the filename name from, using an
  absolute /path/to/filename.

* IMAP mailboxes which show subscribed folders only are now indicated
  by a green folder icon.

* The Icon Legend has had the missing folder icons added and also has
  an improved layout.

* Drafted messages: Do not add Message-ID for draft, unless the
  message already has one. A Message-ID header is now only added when
  queuing a message, and any existing Message-ID and References
  headers in drafts, if there are any, are kept.

* Disable hiding threads and messages in draft folders.

* The /View/Go to/... actions now respect the 'Open message when
  selected' option.

* In the UI 'POP' is used instead of 'POP3', 'IMAP' instead of
  'IMAP4', 'SSL/TLS' instead of 'SSL'.

* GnuTLS: Enforce "strong enough" Diffie-Hellman prime even when
  using older versions of GnuTLS library.

  Since GnuTLS 3.1.7, this minimum size is dictated by the priority
  string, and currently (GnuTLS 3.3.0) the "safe-enough" value is
  1008 bits. We set this minimum size explicitly for older GnuTLS
  versions.

  Users who are affected by this (their servers use DH prime smaller
  than 1008 bits) can override this by using a priority string
  starting with the keyword "LEGACY". However, this keyword only
  works with GnuTLS 3.3.0 or newer.

  are moved to the new file automatically, in the old format. The
  new format will be used whenever old passwords are changed or when
  a Master Passphrase is used. All new passwords are saved using the
  new format, irrespective of whether a Master Passphrase is used or
  not. Further information can be found here:
  http://www.claws-mail.org/doc/password_encryption.txt

  This depends upon the 'Text editor' option (/Configuration/
  Preferences/Message View/External Programs) having a suitable
  value, such as 'gvim -f --socketid %w %s'.

* Address Book: address books can now be searched.

* A hidden pref has been added, 'next_on_delete'. This controls the

* 3.13.0
--------

* Preferences are now saved to disk immediately on pressing OK or
  Apply.

* New preferences have been added for default sorting of the message
  lists. They are found in the 'Message list' frame of the Display/
  Summaries page of the general preferences. These options only apply
  to newly created folders.

* The menu item 'Delete thread' has been moved to the Message menu.
  Previously clicking it would not delete the thread, but just move
  it to the Trash folder. Now it will delete the thread.
  An additional menu item has been added, 'Move thread to trash',
  which implements the original behaviour.

* Compose window: By default it is no longer possible to add user-
  defined headers, with only those pre-defined in the drop down menus
  being possible. To restore the old behaviour, a new hidden
  preference has been added: 'type_any_header', setting this to 1
  restores the old behaviour.

* Automatic account selection is now also applied when you reply to
  one of your own messages, e.g. from the Sent folder.

* Folder list: The Left and Right cursor keys now collapse or expand
  the currently selected folder tree item. The Left cursor key also
  moves the selection to parent folder, if current folder is within
  a collapsed tree.

  first folder and last folder in the tree.

* Account Auto-configuration: when errors occur, a more detailed
  error message is shown.

  the GnuPG executable.

* GnuPG plugins: A new hidden preference has been added which limits
  the number of results returned when using your keyring for address
  auto-completion: 'autocompletion_limit'. The default value is 0,
  which means there is no limit, any other number will limit the
  results to that number.

* Python plugin: Folder has been added to MessageInfo objects.

* The GeoLocation plugin is no longer included.

* The user manual has been updated.

* The man page has been updated.

* Several PGP/Core plugin improvements
  Indicate when a key has been revoked or has expired when displaying
  signature status. For example,
	"Good signature from %s, but the key has expired."
	"Good signature from %s, but the key has been revoked."
  When displaying the full information, show the Validity, and the
  Owner Trust level. Also indicate expired and revoked keys, and
  revoked UIDs.

  The "Content-Disposition: attachment" flag in PGP/MIME signed
  messages has been removed. It was confusing for cetain MUAs.

* A new version of the RSSyl plugin, completely redesigned and
  rewritten. Migration from the previous version is automatic,
  it has a new storage format in ~/.claws-mail/RSSyl/ (hierarchical
  directories instead of flat file format). It uses the expat
  library instead of libxml2 for parsing feed data.

  improved ordering.
	Order of results:

	5. Compare relative position of match
	6. Compare name alphabetically
	7. Compare address alphabetically.
	
* Due to popular demand, use of the Up key in the message body in the
  Compose window stops at the top of the message body and does not
  continue up to the header fields. This reverts the behaviour
  introduced in version 3.10.0.

* In the Compose window, when navigating with the arrow keys,
  selecting, and thus modifying, the Account selector is now
  prevented.

* In the Compose window, a mnemonic (s) has been added to the Subject

* 3.10.0
--------

* Complete SSL certificate chains are now saved, and if built with

  available. Both of these allow correct certificate verification
  instead of a bogus 'No certificate issuer found' status.

  is now possible. (GLib >= 2.22 is required.)

* Added a preference to avoid automatically drafting emails that are

  'folder_search_wildcard', to choose between matching from start of
  the folder name/address or any part of the name. (Activating these
  options restores the previous behaviour.)

* Added hidden preference 'enable_avatars' to control the internal
  capture/render process, and which allows disabling it by external
  plugins for example.

* 'Check for new folders' now only updates the folder list, not
  updating the contents of folders. If needed, it can be followed by
  'Check for new messages'
  
* When using Redirect, the redirecting account's address is used in
  the SMTP MAIL FROM instead of the original sender's address.

* NEW: Libravatar plugin, which displays avatars from
  https://www.libravatar.org/

* Added support for an arbitrary number and sources of 'avatars' and
  images for email senders, and migrated Face and X-Face headers.

  to bypass gpg-agent. The option is disabled if gpg-agent is not
  running.

* TrayIcon plugin: Added 'Hide at startup' and 'Close to tray'
  options.
  When the 'Close to tray' option is used the Window Manager's hotkey
